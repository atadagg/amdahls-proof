# Amdahl's and Gustafson's Laws Proof

This project implements three different algorithms to test and visualize Amdahl's and Gustafson's laws using parallel programming techniques. The implementations use OpenMP for parallelization.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. Matrix Multiplication
2. Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's Shortest Path)
3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## Project Structure

- `matrix_multiplication/`: Matrix multiplication implementation
- `graph_algorithms/`: Graph algorithms implementation
- `tsp/`: Traveling Salesman Problem implementation
- `common/`: Common utilities and helper functions

## Building and Running

Each algorithm has its own directory with specific build instructions. Please refer to the README in each directory for detailed instructions.

## Requirements

- C compiler with OpenMP support (gcc/clang)
- Python 3.13 (for visualization scripts)
- OpenMP library
